# Notes for developers

In the SKAT OIO WSDL files, types are defined by import of external namespaces and nested 
sets of schemas.

This method is valid according to the w3c specifications, and is also the only practical 
way to deal with types that are used across multiple services. The other method of defining 
WSDL files, is by defining types fully inline in the WSDL files. This method is a valid 
alternative according to w3c, but does not scale well across multiple services. 

Some development environments may not include the external schemas correctly. The solution 
is to transform the official WSDL files presented here, into an inlined version of 
the same WSDL file, before generating actual client code. There are tools that can do this. We
have had success using this tool:
